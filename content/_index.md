## About the Project

HoneyBear Folio is built with **Tauri** and **React**, providing a fast, native-feeling desktop experience while keeping your financial data roughly where it belongs: on your own device, effectively in a local SQLite database.

Our goal is to provide advanced portfolio tracking, FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) projections, and privacy without sacrificing usability.
