# HoneyBear Folio Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **HoneyBear Folio**, a privacy-focused, local-first personal finance application.

## Quick Links

* **[Getting Started](getting-started/)**: Installation guides and first-run setup.

* **[FAQ](faq/)**: Common questions about data storage, currency support, and more.

## About the Project

HoneyBear Folio is built with **Tauri** and **React**, providing a fast, native-feeling desktop experience while keeping your financial data roughly where it belongs: on your own device, effectively in a local SQLite database.

Our goal is to provide advanced portfolio tracking, FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) projections, and privacy without sacrificing usability.
