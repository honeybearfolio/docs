# First Run Setup

When you launch HoneyBear Folio for the first time, the **Onboarding Wizard** will appear to help you customize your experience:

1.  **Theme Preference**: Toggle between Dark, Light, or System styling.
2.  **Base Currency**: Select your primary report currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP). All foreign currency accounts will be converted to this value for your "Total Net Worth" KPIs.
3.  **Number Format**: Choose how numbers are formatted (e.g., 1,000.00 vs 1.000,00).
4.  **Date Format**: Choose your preferred date display format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD vs DD/MM/YYYY).
5.  **First Day of Week**: Select the starting day for your calendar weeks (e.g., Monday or Sunday).

Once completed, you will land on the Dashboard. We recommend visiting the **Accounts** tab first to set up your cash and investment accounts.
